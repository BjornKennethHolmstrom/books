Bj√∂rn Kenneth Holmstr√∂m:
I am thinking of a step I could take: Write a book about this (global governance).
It could be named "Globalize: Steps towards a global government", or something in that vein, (perhaps something more inspiring) opening to the possibility of acquiring globalize.org through book sales and donations.
Would you like to help decide on the title and outline the summary/table of contents of the book?
