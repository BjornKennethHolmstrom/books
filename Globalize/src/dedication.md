**Dedication**

To you, dear reader, who holds these pages with hope for our shared future,

To Itxaso, whose love taught me that the deepest connections 
transcend all boundaries,

To life in its infinite expressions—
from the smallest microbe to the largest ecosystem—
weaving together the living tapestry of our planet,

And to humanity, 
standing at the threshold of a new chapter,
ready to write the story of our unified future.

May this book serve as a step toward
the world we know is possible.
