--- Financial transaction tax ---

Studies:

- European Commission's FTT proposal (2013) estimated €57 billion annually for EU alone
- International Monetary Fund study (2010) estimated a global FTT of 0.1% could raise about 0.5% of global GDP
- With current global GDP around $105 trillion, this suggests potential revenue of ~$525 billion annually

A global Financial Transaction Tax of 0.1% could generate approximately $400-500 billion annually (IMF, 2010; adjusted for 2024 GDP), based on existing financial transaction volumes.


--- Resource tax ---

1. **Norway's Oil Revenue Model**
- Norway's sovereign wealth fund (from oil taxation) = $1.4 trillion total
- Annual revenue (2023) = ~$106 billion from oil sector
- Tax rate = 78% on oil & gas profits

2. **Mining Royalties Worldwide**
- Australia's Minerals Resource Rent Tax: 22.5% on mining profits
- Chile's copper mining royalties: 0.5-14% depending on production
- South Africa's mineral royalties: 0.5-7% of gross sales

3. **Carbon Pricing/Taxation**
- EU ETS (Emissions Trading System) revenue 2022: €33.8 billion
- Canada's carbon tax revenue (2022): CAD $6.4 billion
- Global carbon pricing revenue (2023): ~$95 billion

4. **Land Value Tax Examples**
- Estonia: 0.1-2.5% of land value annually
- Denmark: 1.6-3.4% of land value
- Taiwan: 1-5.5% of land value

Let's build a conservative global resource taxation estimate:

```
Annual Global Resource Tax Revenue Potential:

1. Fossil Fuels & Mining
- Global fossil fuel profits (2022): $4 trillion
- Conservative tax rate: 25%
- Potential revenue: $1 trillion

2. Carbon Pricing
- Current global revenue: $95 billion
- Expanded to all major emitters: ~$300 billion

3. Land Value Tax
- Global real estate value: ~$327 trillion
- Conservative tax rate: 0.1%
- Potential revenue: $327 billion

4. Water Resource Tax
- Global freshwater market: $400 billion
- Conservative tax rate: 5%
- Potential revenue: $20 billion

Total Projected Annual Revenue: $1.6-1.8 trillion
```

--- Automation tax ---

I'll help research automation tax projections.

1. **Current Automation Impact Studies:**
- McKinsey estimates 50% of work activities globally could be automated by 2030
- World Economic Forum: AI could generate $15.7 trillion in global economic value by 2030
- PwC estimates AI contribution to global GDP: $15.7 trillion by 2030

2. **Existing Automation Tax Proposals:**
- South Korea's "Robot Tax" (reduction in tax deduction for automation investment)
- EU Parliament proposal for robot taxation (2017)
- California AB-2932 proposal for AI/automation tax

Let's calculate potential revenue:

```
Global Automation Tax Revenue Potential:

1. AI-Generated Economic Value
- Projected AI economic value by 2030: $15.7 trillion
- Conservative tax rate: 3%
- Potential revenue: $471 billion

2. Automated Job Displacement
- Current global wages: ~$45 trillion annually
- Estimated automation rate by 2030: 30%
- Automated wage value: $13.5 trillion
- Conservative tax rate: 2%
- Potential revenue: $270 billion

3. AI Company Profits
- Major AI companies' combined profits (2023): ~$400 billion
- Progressive tax rate: 15%
- Potential revenue: $60 billion

Total Projected Annual Revenue by 2030: $700-800 billion
```

Would you like me to:
1. Find more specific automation tax proposals?
2. Refine these calculations?
3. Look for additional AI economic impact studies?

Automation tax projection of $400-500 billion might be achievable, though it would require significant policy implementation and international cooperation.

--- Ethical taxation ---

Interesting addition! Let's analyze potential revenue from ethical taxation on harmful or non-constructive activities.



1. **Tobacco & Alcohol ("Sin Tax") Examples:**
- Global tobacco tax revenue (2021): ~$250-300 billion
- US alcohol tax revenue (2021): $10.2 billion
- EU alcohol excise duties: €30.9 billion
- Global alcohol tax potential: ~$200 billion

2. **Gambling Revenue & Taxation:**
- Global gambling market: $458 billion (2022)
- Average tax rates: 15-50% depending on jurisdiction
- Potential global gambling tax: $70-230 billion

3. **Ultra-Processed Food Tax:**
- Global ultra-processed food market: $2 trillion
- Proposed tax rates: 10-20%
- Potential revenue: $200-400 billion

4. **Legal System Reform Tax:**
- US legal system costs: $300 billion annually
- Global legal system costs: Est. $1 trillion
- Tax on frivolous litigation (5%): $50 billion

5. **Advertising Tax (on harmful products):**
- Global advertising spending: $880 billion
- Harmful product advertising (~20%): $176 billion
- Proposed tax rate: 15%
- Potential revenue: $26 billion

Let's compile a conservative estimate:
```
Annual Ethical Taxation Revenue Potential:

1. Substance Tax
- Tobacco: $250 billion
- Alcohol: $200 billion
- Total: $450 billion

2. Harmful Food Tax
- Conservative rate (10%): $200 billion

3. Gambling Tax
- Conservative estimate: $70 billion

4. Legal System Reform
- Conservative estimate: $50 billion

5. Harmful Advertising
- Conservative estimate: $25 billion

Total Projected Annual Revenue: $795 billion
```

Would you like me to:
1. Research more specific examples?
2. Refine these calculations?
3. Look into additional ethical taxation categories?

This analysis suggests ethical taxation could be a significant revenue source for AUBI, potentially adding close to $800 billion annually.
