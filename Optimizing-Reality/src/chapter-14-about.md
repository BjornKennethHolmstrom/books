Björn Kenneth Holmström is a **curious thinker, passionate creator, and dedicated systems optimizer**, committed to bridging the gap between **ideas and action**. His journey has taken him across disciplines, cultures, and perspectives, blending **engineering physics, mathematical optimization, software development, philosophy, and creative expression** into a **unified approach to systemic change**.

### **From Physics to Systems Thinking**
With an education in **Engineering Physics** from **the University of Mälardalen** and **Uppsala University**, Björn developed a strong analytical foundation in **mathematical optimization and problem-solving**. His years as a **software developer at TOMLAB Optimization** deepened his interest in **mathematical optimization and programming**.

Beyond academia and industry, Björn’s **self-directed exploration** has led him to study **philosophy, evolutionary psychology, governance, and consciousness**, seeking to **connect disparate fields into a holistic understanding** of reality.

### **A Global Perspective on Intelligence & Ethics**

- **SharedSpheres & CommuniTree** – Platforms designed to **revolutionize collaboration and community-building**.
- **Spiralize.org** – A resource for **learning and applying Spiral Dynamics** in social and political contexts.
- **Sacralize** – A sacred geometry design toolkit that integrates mathematical beauty and functionality.
- **Incentivize.live** - A free resource for finding one's purpose and acting on it.
- **Fjärilspartiet (The Butterfly Party)** – A political movement focused on **holistic, systemic societal transformation**.
- **HeaRTS:** – A unique strategy game designed around **innovative gameplay, education, and ecosystem interaction**.

### **A Life of Creativity and Connection**
Beyond his intellectual pursuits, Björn has a lifelong connection to **music and the arts**. He has played **piano, drums, bass guitar, and acoustic guitar**, performing with bands like **Raskolnikov, Devil Killers, and Fistful of Heart**, as well as recording a **solo album in the 2010s**.

His **love for storytelling, language, and playfulness** is reflected in his online persona **Pwnytale** and his love for **poetry**.

### **A Vision for the Future**
Björn’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that **small, intentional actions can create profound change**. He envisions a world where **all intelligence—human, artificial, ecological, and beyond—collaborates to reduce suffering, optimize governance, and create a thriving civilization**.

His guiding questions include:
- **How can we integrate intelligence, ethics, and technology to serve the highest good?**
- **What underlies the truth of reality?**
- **How can we create governance systems that empower all beings, not just the privileged few?**
