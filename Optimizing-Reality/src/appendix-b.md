---

### **3. Ecological Intelligence Integration (0-20 points)**
Focus: Minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainability.

- **Environmental Impact Awareness (0-5)**:
  - Is the organization tracking its carbon footprint?
  - Are resource usage and waste management monitored?

- **Sustainability Practices (0-5)**:
  - Are there initiatives to reduce waste and recycle resources?
  - Is the organization using renewable energy where possible?

- **Biodiversity Consideration (0-5)**:
  - Does the organization consider its impact on local ecosystems?
  - Are there efforts to protect natural habitats?

- **Sustainable Supply Chain (0-5)**:
  - Are suppliers and partners held to sustainable standards?
  - Is the organization working to reduce its supply chain’s environmental impact?

## **Scoring Guide**
- **Total Score: 0-60** (Simplified from 0-100 in the original framework).
- **0-12**: Early Stage – Significant improvement needed.
- **13-24**: Developing – Basic integration with major gaps.
- **25-36**: Intermediate – Moderate integration with clear areas for improvement.
- **37-48**: Advanced – Strong integration with some refinement needed.
- **49-60**: Exemplary – Outstanding integration across all intelligence types.

---

## **Core Metrics**

### **Human Intelligence Metrics**
- Employee satisfaction score.
- Rate of new ideas implemented.
- Knowledge sharing effectiveness (e.g., % of employees using internal knowledge platforms).

### **AI Integration Metrics**
- AI system adoption rate.
- Error reduction percentage due to AI.
- Employee satisfaction with AI tools.

### **Ecological Intelligence Metrics**
- Carbon footprint reduction rate.
- Waste reduction percentage.
- Renewable energy usage rate.

---

## **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Measurement Frequency**
- **Monthly Review**:
  - Track core metrics (e.g., employee satisfaction, AI adoption rate, carbon footprint).
- **Quarterly Evaluation**:
  - Assess progress in each category and identify areas for improvement.

### **Data Collection Methods**
- **Automated Data Collection**:
  - Use basic analytics tools to track AI performance and resource usage.
- **Human Input Collection**:
  - Conduct quarterly employee surveys to assess well-being and satisfaction.
- **Environmental Monitoring**:
  - Use simple tools (e.g., energy bills, waste tracking) to measure ecological impact.

## **Example Use Case**

**Organization**: A small tech startup with 50 employees.

1. **Assessment**:
   - Human Intelligence: 15/20 (Strong but needs better innovation support).
   - AI Integration: 12/20 (Low adoption rate due to lack of training).
   - Ecological Intelligence: 8/20 (High carbon footprint from office energy use).

2. **Action Plan**:
   - Implement a monthly "innovation hour" for employees to pitch ideas.
   - Provide AI training workshops over the next 2 months.
   - Switch to a renewable energy provider within 6 months.

3. **Outcome**:
   - Employee satisfaction increases by 10%.
   - AI adoption rate rises to 80%.
   - Carbon footprint is reduced by 20%.
